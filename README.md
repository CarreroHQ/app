Modular discord bot written in [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## What do we mean by modular?

In [`src/modules`](https://github.com/martwypoeta/bot/tree/main/src/modules) each file is individual module that can define various things like commands or events. This keeps the code organized because everything related to a specific module is contained within its own file.

Many bots separate commands and events into different folders, which can scatter related code and make it harder to understand.
